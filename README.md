Brain-Inspired Deep Learning Models

Welcome to my Deep Learning Models Repository — a collection of neural network models designed to mimic how the human brain learns patterns, processes information, and makes decisions.

This repository focuses only on deep learning architectures, inspired by artificial neural networks (ANNs), the foundation of modern AI.

🌟 About This Repository

The human brain learns from experience by adjusting connections between neurons.
Similarly, these projects use layers of artificial neurons to learn from data and make intelligent predictions.
